Hello! Mitm Configurator is Python 2.7 script called mitmconfig.py used for configuring your system settings for use with [mitmproxy](http://mitmproxy.org). Mitm Configurator is compatible with both Mac and Linux!

Usually, youâ€™d need to manually set your IP tables, IP forwarding and launch two arpspoof processes to set up your system for mitmproxy, but this scripts helps automates the process and drops you right into [mitmproxy](http://mitmproxy.org)!
